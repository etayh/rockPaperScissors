# rockPaperScissors

Completed first attempt at Rock, Paper, Scissors console game. 
I chose to return the results in alerts rather than a simple console return.
Had difficulty creating a seperate function to house each round 5x, possibly an issue of scope? Hoping that this solution will become more clear after learning to use loops.
